## Project Description
The Student Registration System is a simple Python program that collects basic student information such as name, matriculation number, and department, and then displays the entered details.

---

## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

### 1. Requirement Analysis
The system is required to:
- Accept student name
- Accept matriculation number
- Accept department
- Display the student details

---

### 2. System Design
The system design follows a simple input-output structure:
- User enters student information
- System processes the input
- System displays the entered details

---

### 3. Implementation
The system was implemented using Python.
The following concepts were used:
- Variables
- Input and output statements
- Sequential program flow

---

### 4. Testing
The program was tested using different student details to ensure it works correctly.

| Input | Expected Output |
|------|----------------|
| Name, Matric No, Department | Student details displayed |

The program produced correct output during testing.

---

### 5. Deployment
The project was deployed by uploading the Python source files to a public GitHub repository.

---

### 6. Maintenance
Possible future improvements include:
- Registering multiple students
- Saving student data to a file
- Adding input validation

---

## How to Run the Program
