## Project Description
The Student Grading System is a simple Python program that collects a student’s name and score, then determines and displays the appropriate grade based on predefined conditions.

---

## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

### 1. Requirement Analysis
The system is required to:
- Accept student name
- Accept student score
- Determine grade based on score
- Display student name, score, and grade

---

### 2. System Design
The system design follows a simple decision-based structure:
- Input student details
- Compare score with grading conditions
- Assign appropriate grade
- Display results

---

### 3. Implementation
The system was implemented using Python.
Key programming concepts used include:
- Variables
- Input and output
- Conditional statements (if, elif, else)

---

### 4. Testing
The program was tested using different input values to ensure correctness.

| Input Score | Expected Output |
|------------|----------------|
| 85 | Grade A |
| 65 | Grade B |
| 55 | Grade C |
| 40 | Grade F |

All test cases produced the correct results.

---

### 5. Deployment
The project was deployed by uploading the source code to a public GitHub repository, making it accessible for review and assessment.

---

### 6. Maintenance
Future improvements may include:
- Supporting multiple students
- Saving results to a file
- Adding GPA calculation

---

## How to Run the Program
